# `charlson`: an R package for computing the Charlson comorbidity index.

This package is a simple implementation of the Charlson score in R. The package includes two functions: `charlson`, for computing the Charlson score, and `sample_diag`, for generating ICD-10-like codes at random.

The package is still in development, and not on CRAN.
