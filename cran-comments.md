This is a resubmission.

I added DOIs for the scores in the "Description" field of the DESCRIPTION file.

# Test environments

# R CMD check results on local macOS
0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 notes

# Reverse dependencies

Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Charlson (5:64, 6:4)
  Comorbidity (4:18)
  Elixhauser (6:63, 7:22)
  ICD (8:9)
  Quan (8:23)
  comorbidity (5:24, 7:3)
  
The words above are ok.
